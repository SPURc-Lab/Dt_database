Exploring the transcriptome of non-model oleaginous microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta through high-throughput sequencing and high performance computing

Availability of supplementary datasets
The Illumia HISEQ sequencing data were deposited into GEO with accession number of GSE82121). Transcript sequence file Dt_v11.2.fa (Supplementary dataset 1), Dt_v11.2 annotation file (Supplementary dataset 2), Dt_v11.2 transcriptome associated GO annotation file in .gmt format (Supplementary dataset 3), redundant contigs under the same protein identification (Supplementary dataset 4), and the comparison result of D. tertiolecta potential alternative-splicing variants with other species (Supplementary dataset 5) were hosted at the authorâ€™s GitHub page (https://github.com/SPURc-Lab/).
